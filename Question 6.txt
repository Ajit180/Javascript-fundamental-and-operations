Question 6: Explain the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript.
Provide an example where using a clear identifier improves code readability.

Solution:
  
    Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript is essential for writing clear, understandable, and maintainable code. Well-chosen variable names convey the purpose and context of the data they represent, making the code easier to comprehend and reducing the need for additional comments. Here's why meaningful variable names are important:

### Importance of Meaningful Variable Names
1. Enhanced Readability: Descriptive variable names provide valuable context, allowing developers to understand the purpose and usage of variables at a glance.
  
2. Improved Maintainability: Clear identifiers make it easier to navigate, debug, and modify code, especially for team members who may not be familiar with the codebase.
  
3. Reduced Cognitive Load: Meaningful names reduce the mental effort required to comprehend code, leading to faster understanding and fewer errors.
  
4. Self-Documenting Code: Well-named variables serve as self-documentation, eliminating the need for excessive comments to explain their purpose.
  
5. Prevention of Confusion: Avoiding ambiguous or generic names helps prevent confusion and potential errors caused by misinterpretation of variable intentions.

### Example
Consider the following scenario where using clear identifiers improves code readability:
Example Demonstrating the Importance of Descriptive Variable Names:
Consider the following example, where two variables store the price and quantity of a product. One uses a
meaningful name (productPrice and productQuantity), while the other uses less descriptive names (a and b):

// Less Descriptive Variable Names
let a = 10; // Price of the product
let b = 5; // Quantity of the product
let total = a * b; // Calculate total cost
// More Descriptive Variable Names
let productPrice = 10; // Price of the product
let productQuantity = 5; // Quantity of the product
let totalPrice = productPrice * productQuantity; // Calculate total cost

In this example, the version with descriptive variable names (productPrice, productQuantity, and totalPrice) is
much more understandable. Anyone reading the code can quickly deduce that it calculates the total cost of a
product based on its price and quantity. The version with less descriptive names (a, b, and total) is cryptic and
requires additional mental effort to decipher. Choosing meaningful variable names greatly enhances code
readability and comprehension.
